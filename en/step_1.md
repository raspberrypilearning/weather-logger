## Introduction: 

In this project you will collect data from the Sense HAT's sensors and log it to a file. Then you will use the PyGal module to display that data as a line graph.

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to save data from the Sense HAT sensors to a file and then display the data on a graph with Pygal.

## Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['Weather Logger' Starter Trinket -- jumpto.cc/weather-go](http://jumpto.cc/weather-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [‘Weather Logger’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/5e246d8212](https://trinket.io/python/5e246d8212)

## Offline Resources
This project can also be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/) on a Raspberry Pi computer with a Sense HAT. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ weather/main.py
+ weather/collect.py
+ weather/display.py
+ weather/weather.txt

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ weather-finished/main.py
+ weather-finished/collect.py
+ weather-finished/display.py
+ weather-finished/weather.txt

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ Physical computing - sensors;
+ Data - writing to and reading from files.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ Simulate different weather conditions - use the Sense HAT emulator to simulate different weather conditions. 
+ Record and display humidity or pressure - record data from a different Sense HAT sensor and graph the results.
