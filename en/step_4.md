## Challenge: Simulate different weather conditions

Can you collect and display weather for different weather conditions? Try a hot summer's day where the temperature is over 30 degrees C and a cold winter where the temperature drops below freezing. 

Remember that you'll need to swap between including `collect` and `display` in `main.py`. 

You can just highlight and delete the data in `weather.txt` to clear the data. Or you could create new files to store different readings.
