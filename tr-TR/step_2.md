## Logging the temperature

First let's log the temperature to a file every 5 seconds. You can use the emulator to change the temperature.

+ Open the Weather Logger Starter Trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/weather-go" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/weather-go</a>.
    
    **Some files and code have been added for you.**

+ Click on `collect.py`. This is where you'll write the code to collect the temperature data. Let's open the `weather.txt` file and write the temperature to it every five seconds.
    
    Add the highlighted code to `collect.py`:

    Opening the file with `a` means that data will be appended to the end of the file.
    
    Writing a newline character `\n` puts each temperature reading on its own line.

+ Click on `weather.txt`. It should be empty. This is where the data will be stored.

+ Now click Run. Use the temperature slider on the emulator to change the temperature. You should see the temperature reading added to the end of `weather.txt` every five seconds.
    
    Remember that the emulator tries to behave like a real Sense HAT so you won't see exactly the same reading even if you don't change the emulator.

+ Click the square `Stop` button when you have finished collecting data.

+ You can highlight the data in `weather.txt` and delete it if you want to start collecting new temperature data. Collect around 10 temperature readings.
